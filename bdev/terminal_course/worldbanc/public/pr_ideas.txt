Money Trees for Everyone!: We are literally invested in the environment!
WorldBanc will plant a tree for every new account opened.
But here's the twist – each tree will be adorned with fake dollar bills featuring the CEO's face.
Customers can come and 'harvest' the faux cash from their personal trees, exchanging it for real money at a hilariously low exchange rate.

WorldBanc Cares: Recognizing the importance of personal touch in the digital age,
we introduce a new campaign where the CEO personally writes an email to every customer Mr. Beast style.
To top it off, each email signs off with a digitally autographed photo of the CEO giving a thumbs up.

The WorldBanc Blimp Bonanza: The best way to stay 'above' the competition is quite literal – by investing in a fleet of blimps.
These blimps, emblazoned with the WorldBanc logo, will hover over major cities, occasionally dropping WorldBanc-branded swag like pens, notepads, and stress balls.
The pièce de résistance? Each blimp plays a jingle, the lyrics of which are just the company's stock ticker symbol repeated to a catchy tune.
